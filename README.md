# 🌌 StarGazerApp

StarGazerApp is an AI-powered stargazing and space event forecasting assistant built with a fully open-source tech stack. It helps users identify constellations, track real-time planetary positions, and predict upcoming celestial events like meteor showers and eclipses.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔭 **Real-time Planet Tracking** using accurate astronomical calculations (Skyfield).
- 🌠 **Constellation & Planet Recognition** via AI models (YOLOv8/TensorFlow + OpenCV).
- 📈 **Celestial Event Forecasting** with time-series modeling (Prophet or LSTM).
- 🗺️ **Interactive Sky Map** showing visible stars and planets from your location.
- 🧠 **AI Assistant** to answer astronomy-related queries (LangChain/LLMs).
- 🧩 Modular backend & frontend design for easy extension and customization.
